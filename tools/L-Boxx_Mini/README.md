These are 50% height inserts which stack on top of each other. The upper ones are chiral, the lower ones are symmetric.

## Slicing / Printing
* Material: PETG
* Layer height: 0.25mm

Generally speaking, higher layers make sturdier prints. I am not aware of a "Sturdy yet precice" print mode; in Prusa Slicer, a workaround is to set to "0.10mm DETAIL" and then select Variable Layer Height -> Adaptive.
